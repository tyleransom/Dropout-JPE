\footnotesize Notes: Parameter estimates from a logit predicting probability of graduating in the following period. Estimated only on four-year college students in their junior year and above. Bootstrap standard errors in parentheses. Reference categories for multinomial variables are as follows: ``White'' for race/ethnicity, ``Born in 1984'' for birth year, ``1 year of 2yr college'' and ``3 years of 4yr college and 0 years of 2yr college'' for college experience, ``Not working'' for work intensity, and ``L'' for each unobserved type.
