\footnotesize Note: Model frequencies are constructed using 10 simulations of the structural model for each individual included in the estimation.  We set the panel length in the model to be the same as the panel length in the data. This is because the model assumes random attrition conditional on all observables and unobservables.

White collar offer probability in simulation is 0.3183 and in estimation is 0.3077.
