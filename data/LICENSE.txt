The NLSY data obtained through the Bureau of Labor Statistics is

An extract from the NLSY data was obtained from Fabian Lange's website
(http://www.fabianlange.ca/linked_files/data/AFQT%20MATCHING.zip) for the
purpose of computing equi-percentile mappings of ASVAB test scores across
the NLSY79 and NLSY97.
